```

### Installed Dependencies
- ✅ Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- ✅ Zustand (state management)
- ✅ Howler.js (audio playback)
- ✅ Lucide React (icons)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS (styling)
- ✅ Express, Mongoose, dotenv (backend - optional)

### Features Implemented
- ✅ FreeSound API integration with proxy route
- ✅ Search for loopable sounds (<30s duration)
- ✅ Add multiple audio layers
- ✅ Individual volume controls per layer
- ✅ Play/Pause all layers simultaneously
- ✅ Reset all layers
- ✅ Seamless looping with Howler.js
- ✅ Modern, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ TypeScript type safety

## Next Steps

### 1. Configure Your FreeSound API Key
You need a FreeSound API key to search for sounds:

1. Go to https://freesound.org/
2. Create an account or log in
3. Visit https://freesound.org/apiv2/apply/
4. Create a new application
5. Copy your API key
6. Edit `.env.local` and replace `your_freesound_api_key_here` with your actual key

### 2. Access the App
The development server is running at:
- **Local**: http://localhost:3000
- **Network**: http://192.168.0.223:3000

### 3. Test the App
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Search for sounds (e.g., "rain", "ocean", "forest")
3. Add layers to your soundscape
4. Adjust volumes with the sliders
5. Click Play to start your ambient experience

## Optional Enhancements (From Blueprint)

### Short-term
- [ ] Add crossfade effects between volume changes
- [ ] Add preset soundscape templates
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts

### Medium-term
- [ ] Implement AI prompt interpretation (LLM integration)
- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Save/load soundscapes to MongoDB
- [ ] Export mixed soundscapes as audio files

### Long-term
- [ ] Pre/post-prompt embeddings for better sound matching
- [ ] AI consistency checks for frequency overlap
- [ ] Hybrid AI-generated clips for missing layers
- [ ] Community sharing of soundscapes

## Troubleshooting

### If sounds don't play:
- Check that your FreeSound API key is configured
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure your browser allows audio playback

### If you see TypeScript errors:
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check that all imports use `@/` prefix for src folder

### If the API doesn't return results:
- Verify your `.env.local` file has the correct API key
- Try different search terms (some may have no loopable results)
- Check the FreeSound API status at https://freesound.org/

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## Project Status
✅ MVP Complete and ready for testing!

The core functionality is implemented according to the blueprint. The app can:
- Search FreeSound for loopable clips
- Mix multiple audio layers
- Control individual layer volumes
- Play/pause synchronized playback

AI features are stubbed out and ready for future implementation.
