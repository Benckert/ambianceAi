# ✅ Master Loop Feature Implementation

## What Was Done

Implemented a **30-second master loop system** to solve the "hectic short loop" problem.

## The Problem You Identified

> "The shorter clips running on loop creates a much too hectic sound"

**Before**: Each sound looped continuously at its own rate
- 3s sound = repeats every 3 seconds (10x per 30s)
- Result: Monotonous, robotic, hectic

## The Solution

**After**: All sounds synchronized to 30-second master cycle
- Sounds play at **varied intervals** within the cycle
- Each play has **±1.5s random timing variance**
- New variance pattern every 30 seconds
- Creates **organic, natural** soundscape

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Types (`soundscape.d.ts`)
- Added `duration?: number` to Layer interface
- Allows scheduling based on sound length

### 2. Updated PromptInput
- Passes `duration` from FreeSound API when adding layers
- Enables smart scheduling

### 3. Rewrote SoundscapePlayer
- **No more continuous looping** (`loop: false`)
- **Master loop scheduler**: 30-second cycle
- **Variance system**: ±1.5s randomization
- **Smart distribution**: Based on sound duration
- **Capped plays**: Max 8 plays per sound per cycle

### 4. Updated UI
- New tip explaining master loop system
- Encourages mixing different duration sounds

## How It Works

```
Example: Rain sound (5 seconds duration)

Master Loop (30s):
├─ Play 1: 0.0s (scheduled)
├─ Play 2: 5.2s (5s + 0.2s variance)
├─ Play 3: 9.8s (5s - 0.2s variance)
├─ Play 4: 15.3s (5s + 0.3s variance)
├─ Play 5: 20.1s (5s + 0.1s variance)
└─ Play 6: 24.7s (5s - 0.3s variance)

After 30s: New cycle with different variance!
```

## Benefits

✅ **Less Repetitive**: 30s cycle vs constant 3-5s loops
✅ **More Natural**: Random variance mimics nature
✅ **Better Layering**: Sounds overlap organically
✅ **Less Hectic**: Breathing room between plays
✅ **Evolving**: Each cycle feels slightly different

## Test It

Restart the dev server and try:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Good test searches:**
- "rain ambience" + "thunder" + "wind"
- "ocean waves" + "seagulls" 
- "forest ambience" + "bird chirps"
- "campfire" + "crickets" + "wind"

Add 3-4 layers and press Play. You should hear a much more natural, less hectic soundscape!
